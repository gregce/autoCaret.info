1. More `R`
2. Validation & splitting
3. Pre-processing
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training
6. Model selection
7. Ensembling
8. Validation 
9. Model Extension, etc

# Enter `autoCaret`!

<img src="images/slide5_r.png" width="30%" height="30%" align="right"/>


### What is it?
- An `R` package for data analysts
- Automates training binary classifiers
- Has an easy to GUI via an R Studio Add-in
- Wraps the `caret` and `caretEnsemble` packages
- Allows the analyst to learn in the language they will progress into

# Andy can train a full model in 1 line of `R`

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, comment='#'}
library(autoCaret)
library(mlbench)
data(Sonar)

mod <- autoCaret::autoModel(Sonar, Class, progressBar = FALSE)
```

---

# Andy also gets very useful information about what happened!

```{r warnings=FALSE, eval =FALSE, cache=TRUE, comment='#'}
summary(mod)
```

<img src="images/slide7_summary.png" width="90%" height="90%" align="middle"/>

# A GUI allows him to further compare and explore his models

```{r warnings=FALSE, eval =FALSE, cache=TRUE, comment='#'}
autoCaret:::autoCaretUI()
```

# `autoCaret` does have it's share of advantages!

<img src="images/slide13_advantages.png" width="40%" height="40%" align="right"/>

### Specifically, `autoCaret`:
- Is free and open software with source avaialble on [github](https://github.com/gregce/autoCaret)
- Is accessible to `R` users first and foremost, a large and growing community!
- It joins an extremely strong and vibrant package ecosystem
- It builds on top of two state of the art ML libraries, `caret` and `caretEnsemble` that are well supported
- Compared to some of it's competitors, it has more useful documentation and a simpler interface
- Oh, did we mention? It's free!

# What might the future hold for `autoCaret`?

<img src="images/slide14_future.png" width="40%" height="40%" align="right"/>

- `autoCaret` will continue it's development on [github](https://github.com/gregce/autoCaret)
- Will focus on adding regression capabilities and then look towards unsupervised techniques
- We'll attempt to document and surface "reason codes" to allow for clearer exposition of decision making
- We will likely reach out and partner with Max Kuhn and Zach Mayer (creators of caret and caretEnsemble respectively)
- A list of to-do's and open issues is available [here]()
